# Outliers
---
In statistics, outliers are data points that donâ€™t belong to a certain population. It is an abnormal observation that lies far away from other values. An outlier is an observation that diverges from otherwise well-structured data.

For Example, you can clearly see the outlier in this list: [20,24,22,19,29,18,**4300**,30,18]

### Types of Outliers

* **Univariate**
  - Univariate can be found when we looking at a distribution of values in single feature space 
* **multivariate**
  - multivariate outlier can be found in n dimensional space

### Different flavours of outliers

- Point (Single Data point Outlier)
- Contextual (Noise in data)
- Collective (subset of novelties in data)
